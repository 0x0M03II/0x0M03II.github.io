## Public-Key Cryptography

Public-Key cryptography works by using pairs of mathematically related keys generated by cryptographic algorithms.  These cryptographic algorithms are based on difficult ( one-way ) mathematical problems, such as the discrete logarithm.  In other words, the security of many public-key cryptographic algorithms depends on mathematical and computational difficulty.  A key pair consists of a private key and a public key; the private key should never be shared with anyone.  Public-key algorithms support encryption and digital signatures.

Encryption provides confidentiality and works by using a recipients public key to encrypt a message.  Once the message is received, the recipient will use his or her own private key to decrypt the message.

Digital signatures provide integrity and non-repudiation.  Integrity refers to ther assurance that the data is accurate and has not been changed.  Non-repudiation is the inability for someone to deny the origin or source of data.  An example use case would be for a service such as Docusign, where authenticity of a signature is vital, and, once a contract is signed, it should not be possible for anyone to deny that authenticity.  In order to provide a digital signature, the sender of a message will encrypt the hash of the message using their private key.  The receiver of a message will use the senders public key to decrypt the hash, and compare the message hash computed by the sender with the hash computed locally.

### Math Background  

I will briefly introduce a few mathematical properties necessary for understanding Diffie-Hellman and RSA.  This is by no means comprehensive, and you are encouraged to do additional reading on your own.

#### Division and Remainder
- &forall; a,b &isin; &Zopf; , &exist; q, r &isin; Z such that a = b * q + r :

    - a is the dividend
    - b is the divisor
    - q is the quotient
    - r is the remainder

- &lfloor; a/b &rfloor; = q
- a &equiv; r (mod b)

Then to render this category using link and pages. All we need to do is,

1. Create a new file with [your_category_name].md inside categories folder.

2. Copy categories/sample_category.md file and replace the content in [your_category_name].md in that. (Please don't copy the code below its just sample, since it renders the jekyll syntax dynamically)

```jsx
---
layout: page
title: Guides
permalink: /blog/categories/your_category_name/
---

<h5> Posts by Category : {{ page.title }} </h5>

<div class="card">
{% for post in site.categories.your_category_name %}
 <li class="category-posts"><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &nbsp; <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</div>
```

Using the category, all the posts associated with the category will be listed on
`http://localhost:4000/blog/categories/your_category_name`
