## Learn about Linkers
Whether your interested in low-level development or reverse engineering malware, understanding how linkers work and being able to write your own linker script is an important skill.

I recently created a gitbook, that provides a nice introduction in to linkers.  My knowledge base will explain the general purpose of a linker and walk you through a default linker script generated by the GNU linker, ld, for ELF binaries.

I've also included some additional resources for those interested in learning more.
